# MyJavaRepos
 Contains my Java projects.

1. DBConnection: A console software aimed to use HikariCP(https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) to interact with my PostgreSQL database. It can implement user authentication, keep track of orders and inventory, and simulates the business logic of a online shopping system where customers can register, login, browse, search, add to chart, check out etc.

2. HTTPServer: A simple server that handles HTTP request. It implements multithreading to handle sockets and encapsulation to manage requests and responses, and also interacts with database based on the previous DBConnection project.
